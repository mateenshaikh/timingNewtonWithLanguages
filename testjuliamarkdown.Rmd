knitr::knit_engines$set(julia = JuliaCall::eng_juliacall)
```


This documents the timings of a simple newton method in R, C (technically cpp but it's all just C), and julia.

The function is $f_0(x)=e^x+\sin(x)$ so the newton update would be
$$x\leftarrow x-\frac{f_0(x)}{f_1(x)}=x-\frac{e^x+sin(x)}{e^x+cos(x)}$$

applied repeatedly. A graph of the curve is shown below. It's already fairly linear so the function will hit the root very quickly but that's ok. 



```{r,cache=T}
curve(exp(x)+sin(x),-1,0)
```
We'll run the code a fixed number of iterations. I don't know if hitting 0 in the numerator does any short-cutting in any language but thats ok for now.


### Julia code
The julia is shown below. These lines are actually run in julia but at the end we'll call it from R, so the code will be revisted at the end.

```{julia}
f0(x)=exp(x)+sin(x)
f1(x)=exp(x)+cos(x)
update(x)=x-f0(x)/f1(x)
function getroot_julia()
  x=0.0
    for i in 1:50000000
        x=update(x)
    end
    return x
end


using BenchmarkTools
timing_julia = @benchmark getroot_julia() samples=5 evals=5
print(timing_julia)
```

## R code
The r code is shown below.

```{r,cache=T}
getroot_r=function(){
  x=0.0
  ee=0
  for (i in 1:50000000){
    ee=exp(x)
    x=x-(ee+sin(x))/(ee+cos(x))
  }
  return (x);
}
```

## R cpp code

This is the rcpp code is shown here

```{Rcpp,cache=T}
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;

//[[Rcpp::export]]
double getroot_cpp() {
  double x=0.0;
  double ee=0.0;
  for(int i=0;i<50000000;i++){
    ee=exp(x);
    x=x-(ee+sin(x))/(ee+cos(x));
  }
  return (x);
}
```

## julia
The julia code (same as the code above) is entered into R so it can be called from R.

```{r,cache=F,warning=F}
library(JuliaCall)
julia_command("f0(x)=exp(x)+sin(x)")
julia_command("f1(x)=exp(x)+cos(x)")
julia_command("update(x)=x-f0(x)/f1(x)")
julia_command("function getroot_julia()
    x=0.0
    for i in 1:50000000
        x=update(x)
    end
    return x
end")
```

# Results

Now that all the functions are created and available, they're assessed in R. Each runs the same number of iterations with the same initial guess. Each language's implementation is run a few times times.
```{r,cache=F}
library(microbenchmark)
results = microbenchmark(getroot_r(),getroot_cpp(),julia_eval("getroot_julia()"),times=5)
```


```{r,cache=F}
languages = c("R","cpp","julia")
boxplot(results,names=languages)
print(results)
medians = summary(results)[,"median"]
names(medians)=languages

#speeds relative to r
medians/max(medians)

#speeds relative to julia
medians/min(medians)

```
